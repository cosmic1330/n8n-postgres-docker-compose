- Always respond in 繁體中文
- Before writing any code, read memory-docs/tech.md, memory-docs/PRD.md, and memory-docs/architecture.md.
- When adjusting, adding, or removing records related to data structures, file purposes, or key decisions, update memory-docs/architecture.md accordingly.
- Once the implementation plan and task is finished or accept, add content in memory-docs/implementation_plan.md and flag it success.
- Please execute the tasks strictly in the order defined in the Implementation Plan.
After completing each task, perform the required verification or testing. Only proceed to the next task once the current task has been confirmed to be correct and issue-free.
- Any required additions or changes to memory-docs/tech.md, memory-docs/PRD.md, or memory-docs/architecture.md identified after completion should be updated concurrently.           
- memory-docs/goal.md is the main document defining the primary objectives of this requirement.
- Unless there is a major change in the direction of goal.md, do not clear the existing content in implementation_plan.md. When a new implementation plan is created, append it incrementally. Make sure to clearly separate the content of each implementation plan for readability and traceability.
